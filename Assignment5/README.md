Assignment 5

To run the code: python Larsen_Assignment5.py World1.txt <value for epsilon>

The optimal path did change when I changed the value for epsilon, but only when I entered 10000 as the value for epsilon. I tried 0.5, 10, 25, 500, 1000, and 10000 as a value for epsilon. 
However, the utility values always changed when I changed the value for epsilon.
